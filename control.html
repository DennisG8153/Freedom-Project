        <h2 class="cen">Controls of a Robot</h2>
        <img src="robot-control.png" class="center">
    <p> The core of a robot isn't what everyone thinks it is. Sure it does contain all those gears, lights, and bolts but there is always more to do. These controls aren't complete without the coding side of a robot's control. A robot has 3 main parts, sensors, code and the board. The sensors allow for the robot to transmit it's responses for the code and the board to know what to do next. For example, if a button was pushed, the robot would respond with the word 'wall.' The next part of the robot's control is the code itself. You need the code in order to make sure the robot does something. In the example from earlier, we would use the code: if button was pushed, then say 'wall' in order for it to work. The last part of a robot's control is the board. Now these boards come in many spahes and sizes, even like the one you see above. These boards are like the transport systems of the robot, built in order to transfer code and resposes back and forth, while also storing these responses. This is appicable to what's happening above, we use the sensor of a button to transmit the function of saying the word 'wall' which is stated by the code. If any of these 3 parts does not function properly, the robot will ultimately fail and not work. </p>

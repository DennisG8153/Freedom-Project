    <!-- Note this is going to change drastically come the weekend. -->
    <p> This is where we would talk about updates to latest robot models and their functions. Though as of late, there isn't much to report considering we are in a pandemic and all. During CES convention, the world was shown some new robots, some of which are actually kind of interesting to read about. Here are the 3 most interesting ones to learn about. Let's see more below! </p>

   <p> Charmin's Rollbot is a little bear like robot with no arms, hands or thumbs, will connect you with your phone in order to balance toliet paper. This would be usefull when you're in a pinch and don't have any toliet paper around, the robot would deliver it to you.  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/charmin-robots-make-us-wonder-is-pooping-next-tech-frontier/">Link for Robot #1</a></p> 
      <p> This next bot is a little like an emotional support animal. Groove X's huggable robot LOVOT is a cross between a bear and an owl and is very unique personality and also a unique voice. It's connected via an app and once it's configured, there's only fun to be had. It's even the picture above! <a href="https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2020/Honorees/L/LOVOT.aspx">Link for Robot #2</a></p>
      <p> Last, but certainlly not least is our waiter bot called the BellaBot. This little cute cat themed waiter is purrfect for any kawaii-themed japanese resturant. It meows when plates are needed to be picked up and it helps to transport consumers food. <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/ces-2020-the-best-tech-gadgets-on-show-so-far/9/"> Link for Robot #3</a></p>
